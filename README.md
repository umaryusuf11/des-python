# des-python
The aim of this exercise is to have students use the knowledge theyâ€™ve acquired so far
in the second part of the course, in the context of implementing a set of scheduling
algorithms. You will be using and extending a simple discrete event simulator written
in Python, by creating classes that simulate the scheduling and dispatching of
processes performed by four scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS),
Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Round-Robin (RR) and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF).
This assessed exercise will also act as a gentle introduction to such concepts as
queuing theory, discrete event simulation, and object-oriented software engineering.
